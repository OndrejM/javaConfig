# Configuration for Java SE and EE JSR

## Rational

Many project artifacts should only be created once but still need to target different execution environments.
Depending on the situation they need different configuration.

This is easily achievable by having a set of default configuration values inside the project artifact.
But be able to overwrite those default values from external.

## History

This very configuration approach has it's roots in the Apache OpenWebBeans internal SPI configuration.
In 2010 it got moved over to the Apache MyFaces CODI project and enhanced to also fit the need of customer projects by Gerhard Petracek and Mark Struberg.
In 2012 we further enhanced it while moving CODI to the Apache DeltaSpike project.

## How it works

A 'Configuration' consists of the information collected from the registered `javax.config.spi.ConfigSource` s.
These `ConfigSource`s get sorted according to their _ordinal_.
That way it is possible to overwrite configuration with lower importance from outside.

By default there are 3 default ConfigSources:

 * `System.getenv()` (ordinal 400)
 * `System.getProperties()` (ordinal 300)
 * all `META-INF/java-config.properties` files on the ClassPath. (ordinal 100, separately configurable via a config_ordinal property inside each file)
